## Wallpaper Engine Crash Quick Fix Attempt

If you are unsure what is crashing Wallpaper Engine, please do a clean re-installation of your graphics card drivers. That means you need to first uninstall your drivers and then re-install the latest drivers after your current drivers have been fully uninstalled. Some drivers offer a "Perform clean re-installation" option in the advanced section, be sure to enable that option to automatically clean any remnants of broken drivers. You can get the latest graphics card drivers from all big vendors here:

* [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
* [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/support)
* [Intel Graphics](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)

If you have an antivirus application installed (except Windows Defender), make sure to set up an exception for Wallpaper Engine in your antivirus settings. Sometimes a re-installation of Wallpaper Engine is necessary after this if your antivirus has permanently broken or locked some files.

Always also try to verify the Wallpaper Engine files through steam to ensure they are not broken:

### MMDEvAPI.dll

This type of crash occurs to due broken audio software installed on your system. This is usually caused by "sound enhancement" software, especially the ones pre-installed on various notebooks. This type of software will often cause crashes because they interact with Windows in a buggy way, try and look for "Sonic Studio" or "Nahimic" and update them. If you cannot find an update for these programs, you can also uninstall them as they are not necessary for your computer audio to function properly.

### fraps32.dll

The crash has been caused by the FPS monitor and screen recording app Fraps. Fraps has not received updates since 2013 and is a heavily outdated application. Please use an alternative to Fraps as this is a Fraps bug which may never be fixed as the software is abandoned.

## Crash error 0xc000007b

This means that a Windows module has been corrupted by something on your system - usually DirectX itself is broken in this case. Try manually deleting these files:

* C:\Windows\SysWOW64\d3dx9_43.dll
* C:\Windows\System32\d3dx9_43.dll

Now install them again with the DirectX 9 installer: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\_CommonRedist\DirectX\Jun2010\dxsetup.exe* (The exact location depends on where your wallpaper_engine installation directory is).

If you still get this error it might be another, similar DirectX module that has been broken by something. This usually indicates a bigger underlying issues with your Windows installation which you need to fix before you can run Wallpaper Engine.

## Crashing after Hibernation / Sleep

If Wallpaper Engine crashes after Windows hibernation, then Windows is failing to correctly restore your graphics card drivers and Wallpaper Engine together. Hibernation in Windows is simply not a reliable process. You can enable the option **Safe start after hibernation** in Wallpaper Engine to mitigate this issue. This option will attempt to automatically restart Wallpaper Engine instead of expecting Windows to correctly work after hibernation.
