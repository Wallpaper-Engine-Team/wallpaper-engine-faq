# Steam 收藏庫中找不到 Wallpaper Engine

如果您已在 Steam 上購買 Wallpaper Engine，在 Steam 收藏庫中卻找不到，最常見的原因是您的 Steam 設定為僅顯示**遊戲**。 Wallpaper Engine 並不是遊戲，故務必在 Steam 收藏庫分頁上方的篩選欄位勾選**軟體**的選項，如下所示：

If this filter does not exist for you or if you are still unable to find Wallpaper Engine in your library, be sure to check the purchase history of the Steam account to double-check that the account you are using really owns Wallpaper Engine. You can view your purchase history on the following page (make sure you are logged into the correct Steam account):

* [Steam Account Purchase History](https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/)

If you are still unable to find Wallpaper Engine in your Steam account, please reach out to the Steam Support team directly. Unfortunately developers on Steam have no access to Steam account data and cannot provide support with this, only the Steam team can help with account and purchase related issues:
