# 工作坊協議增補條款

隨著 Wallpaper Engine 2.0 推出，使用者得以將工作坊桌布傳輸至 Android 行動裝置。 行動裝置無法直接存取任何工作坊內容，使用者必須將 Wallpaper Engine 的 Windows 版本桌布傳輸至 Android。

如果您曾為 Wallpaper Engine 創作桌布，則必須同意最新的 Wallpaper Engine 工作坊協議增補條款，如此一來，使用者方可將您創作的桌布傳輸至其行動裝置。 未經桌布建立者同意，Wallpaper Engine 不允許使用者將桌布傳輸至行動裝置。

Since transferring Steam Workshop content to mobile devices has never been done before, the Steam Workshop Agreement does not cover this type of activity. We created an addendum to the Steam Workshop Agreement to ensure content creators are aware of the ability to transfer content to mobile devices. You can review and accept the addendum in either of the links below:

* [Workshop Addendum (View in Web Browser)](https://store.steampowered.com/workshopeula/431960/)
* <a href="steam://url/WorkshopEula/431960/">Workshop Addendum (View in Steam)</a>

If you are trying to use a wallpaper from a content creator that has not yet agreed to the latest Workshop addendum, please ask the content creator to review the latest addendum. You will be able to transfer the wallpaper to your Android mobile device once the creator has accepted the latest agreement.
