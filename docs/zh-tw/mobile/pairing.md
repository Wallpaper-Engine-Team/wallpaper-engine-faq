# 行動裝置與 Windows 配對

您可將行動裝置與電腦配對．將桌布收藏無線傳輸至行動裝置上的 Wallpaper Engine 隨附應用程式。 Android 應用程式無法直接從 Steam 工作坊下載桌布，因為只有 Steam 本身才能下載桌布檔案。

### 在 Windows 上準備 Wallpaper Engine

在 **Windows** 應用程式中，在使用者介面的右上角按一下 **行動裝置**按鈕。 行動裝置的概覽將隨即開啟。 在裝置概覽的底部，按一下**連接新的行動裝置**按鈕。 Wallpaper Engine 將顯示 4 位數的 PIN 碼，可用來與一個行動裝置配對。

### 連接行動裝置

In the Wallpaper Engine mobile companion app, click on **Add** in the lower right corner, followed by clicking on **Pair with Computer**. The Wallpaper Engine app will search your local network for running instances of Wallpaper Engine for Windows. Your Windows computer should appear after a few seconds, allowing you to connect to it by clicking on it. If you are connecting for the first time, you will be asked to enter the 4-digit PIN (see Windows section above). The PIN is an additional security measure to ensure unauthorized users cannot connect to your computer without your knowledge.

Once you have entered your PIN, the status bar in the mobile app turns green and shows which computer its connected to. On the Windows app, the **Mobile** button is also colored green now to indicate that a mobile connection is active.

## Mobile Pairing Problem Solving

If you cannot pair your mobile device to your computer, a firewall or local network setting is very likely at fault. Check the following possible problem sources:

* Ensure that your phone and computer are connected to the same local network.
* Ensure no firewall is blocking Wallpaper Engine from communicating with your local network.
* Ensure your network router is not blocking your devices from communicating with each other.
* Double-check that Wallpaper Engine on Windows and your mobile device are both up-to-date and running.
