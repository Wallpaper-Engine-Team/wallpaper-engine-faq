## 無法在 Android 上設定動態桌布

依據使用的裝置製造商與 Android 啟動器的不同，您可能無法在鎖定螢幕上設定動態桌布，或只能在主螢幕設定相同的桌布。

在手機上的 Wallpaper Engine 預覽動態桌布時，長按右上角的勾號幾秒鐘， 就能打開手機上的動態桌布螢幕。 Depending on your manufacturer, you should now see the option to set the wallpaper on your lock-screen - if this option does not appear, your phone does not support live wallpapers on the lock-screen. The following phone manufacturers are known to not allow live wallpapers on the lock-screen on all or some of their devices:

* 華為
* 小米

## How to unset Wallpaper Engine wallpaper

If you wish to stop using a Wallpaper Engine wallpaper, you can simply assign a new wallpaper in your Android settings. Wallpaper Engine is just another wallpaper to Android and wallpapers cannot unset themselves.

Alternatively, you can uninstall Wallpaper Engine entirely which will cause your phone to revert to its default wallpaper.

## Android wallpaper regularly disappears or crashes silently

If you are using Wallpaper Engine as a wallpaper but the wallpaper disappears without any error messages after a few hours, days or weeks, it is likely being falsely terminated by your phone's power saving functionality. Under normal circumstances, Android should never terminate live wallpapers for power saving purposes but some users have reported this happening to them. This depends largely on your device manufacturer, if Wallpaper Engine disappears regularly, disable power optimization for Wallpaper Engine in your Android settings. This differs depending on your Android version and device, if you are unsure, search the web for ways to disable power optimization for apps on your exact mobile device name.
