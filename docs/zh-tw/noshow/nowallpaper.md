# 看不見桌布

如果部分或所有桌布並未顯示，原因通常是防毒應用程式錯誤封鎖了 Wallpaper Engine。 如果您使用防毒應用程式，請設定為忽略 *wallpaper_engine* 安裝目錄以及所有重要的 Wallpaper Engine 可執行檔：

* *wallpaper_engine/wallpaper32.exe*
* *wallpaper_engine/wallpaper64.exe*
* *wallpaper_engine/launcher.exe*
* *wallpaper_engine/bin/webwallpaper32.exe*
* *wallpaper_engine/bin/ui32.exe*

::: tip
如果您安裝了防毒應用程式 (Windows Defender 除外)，很可能就是原因。 如果您試了幾次都無法解決此問題，請花些時間確認。

## High-contrast mode in Windows

If you have enabled **high-contrast mode** in your Windows 10 theme settings with the **High Contrast White** theme selected, Windows will forcibly turn off Wallpaper Engine wallpapers. Try changing the high-contrast theme you are using in the high-contrast settings of Windows or turn high-contrast mode off entirely and the issue will disappear.

## Conflicts with other desktop modification software

Wallpaper Engine works well with most desktop-modification applications. However, some applications such as StarDock DeskScapes also modify the Windows wallpaper and it is not possible to run both applications at the same time. If you use a similar application to Wallpaper Engine, you will need to decide on one which you want to continue to use.

### Fences

Generally, Wallpaper Engine works fine with *Fences*. However, **if you have Fences installed but have disabled it**, it will hide the wallpaper from Wallpaper Engine. You need to either enable or uninstall it completely.

## Gray Wallpaper or missing textures on Windows 7

Make sure that the Windows 7 update **KB2533623** is installed. Either install it manually with that link or ensure that your Windows Update is working right and installing it by itself. You can download it manually from the Microsoft website, restart your system afterwards and the problem should go away:
