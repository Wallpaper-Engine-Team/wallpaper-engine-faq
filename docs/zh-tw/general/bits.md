# 32 位元與 64 位元版本

We recommend using the 64-bit version of Wallpaper Engine since the 64-bit version can handle larger files (more than 2GB). Other than that, the two versions are the same and also deliver the same level of visual fidelity and performance.

In rare cases, switching to the 32-bit version may help you resolve issues with broken 64-bit Windows components, drivers, video codec packs and other app incompatibilities. This may help you fix specific Wallpaper Engine problems without resolving the underlying issue on your system.

注意
「網頁」類型的桌布必定以 32 位元的可執行檔 (webwallpaper32.exe) 執行， 使用者介面本身也是 (ui32.exe)。 僅在選擇「場景」或「視訊」時才適用 64 位元的可執行檔。

## 如何將 Wallpaper Engine 設定為在 Windows 啟動時以 32 位元或 64 位元版本自動啟動？

First, completely turn off Wallpaper Engine via the tray icon (right-click on the Wallpaper Engine icon in the Windows tray, then select "Quit"). Do not skip this step, as Steam will otherwise not restart Wallpaper Engine and only bring the already running version to the foreground.

Once Wallpaper Engine is turned off, go to Steam and start either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, depending on which version you want to automatically start. Next, go to the Wallpaper Engine settings and at the top of the "General" tab, enable the automatic startup functionality. 如果該功能已顯示啟用，請完全關閉後再重新開啟。 如此將使目前版本登錄為隨 Windows 開機而自動啟動的版本。
