# Windows 鎖定畫面設定為 Wallpaper Engine 桌布

The login screen is very secure and not accessible by normal means. Only dangerous Windows hacks may accomplish this by patching or hooking into the login screen process. Due to this, you could get permanently locked out of your PC when an error occurs or a Windows update changes the lockscreen structure in an unexpected way.

If a safe method is made public or reverse-engineered by us, we will implement this feature. Currently there are no known safe ways to accomplish this, which is why live wallpapers cannot be set on the lockscreen.

然而，您仍可設定 Wallpaper Engine 以使用目前動態桌布的快照來覆寫靜態鎖定畫面圖像。 請至 Wallpaper Engine 設定的**一般**分頁啟用**覆寫鎖定畫面圖像**選項。

## 螢幕保護程式功能

若不需要鎖定畫面，建議可將 Wallpaper Engine 設定為螢幕保護程式，並在螢幕保護程式設定頁面中勾選**繼續執行後，顯示登入畫面**。 請見我們的螢幕保護程式指南，了解如何將 Wallpaper Engine 設定為螢幕保護程式：
