# Wallpaper Engine bloqueia

O Wallpaper Engine é software amadurecido, utilizado por milhões e bem testado - é relativamente raro que realmente haja erros na aplicação que provoquem bloqueios. Se a mensagem de bloqueio que está a ver mecionar quaisquer ficheiros **.dll**, consulte a lista que se segue e tente encontrar uma descrição mais precisa do **.dll** específico que causou o bloqueio do seu sistema:

::: tip
Quase todos os relatórios de bloqueios que recebemos de utilizadores acabam por ser causados por controladores gráficos danificados, aplicações antivírus ou outro software defeituoso que torna o computador instável.

## Tentativa de correção rápida de bloqueio do Wallpaper Engine

Se não estiver certo do que está a bloquear o Wallpaper Engine, faça uma reinstalação limpa dos controladores da sua placa gráfica. Isto significa que primeiro deve reinstalar os seus controladores e depois reinstalar os controladores mais recentes depois dos seus controladores atuais serem completamente desinstalados. Alguns controladores oferecem uma opção para "Efetuar reinstalação limpa" na secção avançada, mas certifique-se de que ativa essa opção para limpar automaticamente quaisquer resquícios dos controladores danificados. Pode obter aqui os controladores mais recentes para placas gráficas de todos os grandes fabricantes:

* [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/support)
* [Intel Graphics](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)

Caso possua qualquer aplicação antivírus instalada (exceto Windows Defender), certifique-se de que configura uma exceção para o Wallpaper Engine nas definições do seu antivírus. Por vezes é necessário reinstalar o Wallpaper Engine depois disto se o seu antivírus tiver permanentemente danificado ou bloqueado alguns ficheiros.

Experimenta também verificar os ficheiros do Wallpaper Engine através do Steam para garantir que não estão danificados:

## Crashing after Hibernation / Sleep

If Wallpaper Engine crashes after Windows hibernation, then Windows is failing to correctly restore your graphics card drivers and Wallpaper Engine together. Hibernation in Windows is simply not a reliable process. You can enable the option **Safe start after hibernation** in Wallpaper Engine to mitigate this issue. This option will attempt to automatically restart Wallpaper Engine instead of expecting Windows to correctly work after hibernation.

## Wallpaper Engine was likely crashed by another application

This crash usually happens due to an issue in Windows itself. Try to re-install the latest version of your sound card drivers as this may fix the problem.

* [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

### igdumd64.dll / igd10umd64.dll / igdumdx32.dll / igd10umd32.dll

The Intel graphics drivers on your system are crashing. Go to the Intel website, download the latest drivers from there and install them:

### RZChromaSDK.dll / RzChromaSDK64.dll

These types of crashes are caused by Razer Chroma which is part of **Razer Synapse**. Usually, this is caused by a faulty installation of Razer Synapse. In most cases, a clean reinstallation of Razer Synapse fixes these types of crashes:

**Clean reinstallation of all Razer software**

::: warning
Make sure Wallpaper Engine is turned off while reinstalling Razer Synapse.
:::

1. Turn off Wallpaper Engine completely if it is running (right-click on the icon in the Windows tray and then select **Quit**)
2. Uninstall all Razer software from your computer through Windows
3. Download the latest version of Razer's software suite from their website and install it:

* [Download Razer Synapse 3](https://www.razer.com/synapse-3)

4. Afterwards restart your computer without restarting Wallpaper Engine beforehand.

**Reinstallation does not fix the problem**

If the issue is not resolved by a reinstallation of Razer Synapse, there may be an underlying issue with Razer Synapse itself, in the past this has been caused by faulty Razer Synapse updates. Try turning off the LED Plugin (*"iCUE & Chroma SDK"*) in the **Plugins** tab of the Wallpaper Engine settings until this problem is fixed in a future Razer Synapse update.

If the crashes persist even after a clean reinstallation of Razer Synapse, please contact Razer support directly and inform them about the crashes. If they are unable to help, please reach out to us for technical support - we can look into these crashes and forward our findings to the Razer Synapse development team as well though Razer should be the main contact for this specific crash.

### MMDEvAPI.dll

This type of crash occurs to due broken audio software installed on your system. This is usually caused by "sound enhancement" software, especially the ones pre-installed on various notebooks. This type of software will often cause crashes because they interact with Windows in a buggy way, try and look for "Sonic Studio" or "Nahimic" and update them. If you cannot find an update for these programs, you can also uninstall them as they are not necessary for your computer audio to function properly.

### fraps32.dll

The crash has been caused by the FPS monitor and screen recording app Fraps. Fraps has not received updates since 2013 and is a heavily outdated application. Please use an alternative to Fraps as this is a Fraps bug which may never be fixed as the software is abandoned.

## Crash error 0xc000007b

This means that a Windows module has been corrupted by something on your system - usually DirectX itself is broken in this case. Try manually deleting these files:

* C:\Windows\SysWOW64\d3dx9_43.dll
* C:\Windows\System32\d3dx9_43.dll

Now install them again with the DirectX 9 installer: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\_CommonRedist\DirectX\Jun2010\dxsetup.exe* (The exact location depends on where your wallpaper_engine installation directory is).

If you still get this error it might be another, similar DirectX module that has been broken by something. This usually indicates a bigger underlying issues with your Windows installation which you need to fix before you can run Wallpaper Engine.
