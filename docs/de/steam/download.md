# Steam Wallpaper Download Issues

Keep in mind that **all downloads are performed by Steam**. Wallpaper Engine only shows the Steam download status, all download problems are related to issues with your Steam and not directly related to Wallpaper Engine. This guide contains a collection of the most common issues with downloads, in many cases the initial cause of problems are overzealous antivirus applications or blocked network ports.

If you are having issues with Steam downloads, make sure no antivirus application is blocking your Steam and that all necessary ports are open in your firewall - including any firewalls in your network routers.

::: tip You can easily check if your network router is blocking Steam downloads by switching to a mobile hotspot on your smartphone and attempt to download a wallpaper through that. :::

## Wallpaper download stuck at 0% or 100% (or any other percentage)
Steam is not done downloading and verifying the files. If the downloads are stuck for a while, try these things if your Steam downloads do not work even after you waited for a while:

* Clear Steam's download cache in Steam's options:
  * [Clear Steam Download cache](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3134-TIAL-4638)
* Afterwards verify the files of Wallpaper Engine in Steam:
  * [Verify Wallpaper Engine files](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335)
* If all downloads are still stuck: **Turn off Steam** and afterwards **delete the contents** of this directory:
  * `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\downloads`
    * If you have an anti-virus application installed, make sure that it's specifically excluding this directory
    * **Note:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam` is the default Steam path, if you have installed it somewhere else, check there.
* Restart Steam. Do not start any games. Check in the Steam download tab for progress and resume any paused downloads.

* Make sure no anti-virus or firewall is blocking Steam. Exclude the whole Steam directory in your anti-virus app settings.
* Unsubscribe the wallpapers that fail to download and subscribe to them again after restarting Steam.
* Choose a different content server in Steam's settings. The option can be found in the "Downloads" tab of the Steam settings.
* Make sure you did not restrict Steam downloads in the **Steam settings** based on time, bandwidth, being in-app.
* Open the 'Downloads' tab in Steam (Library -> Downloads). Look for paused downloads. If you can see any, click on 'Resume'.
* Right-click Wallpaper Engine in Steam, then Properties, then select **Allow Background Downloads**.
* Make sure you do not have pending game updates in Steam, it could pause or disable wallpaper downloads.
* Try again after waiting at least for a day in case there are Steam server issues.
* **As a last resort**, try to re-install Wallpaper Engine to clear any broken Steam files (this will re-download all wallpapers!). :::

::: tip Steam servers go offline every week for maintenance at a fixed time:

* United States West Coast: **Tuesday at 4 pm (UTC - 7)**
* Same time in Central Europe: **Wednesday at 1 am (UTC + 1)**
* Same time in China: **Wednesday at 8 am (UTC + 8)**

If you are reading this while it is roughly this time of the week, it may be that the servers are temporarily offline. Wait one or two hours and try again. :::

## Steam: "Missing Downloaded Files" error

Steam is unable to download some files, this can be due to anti-virus applications blocking Steam or just absolutely random. It can usually be fixed this way:

* Turn off Steam.
* Delete the contents of this directory: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\downloads`
* Delete the contents of this directory: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\downloading\431960`
  * **Note:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam` is the default Steam path, if you have installed it somewhere else, check there.
* Start Steam and verify the Wallpaper Engine files:
