# "Content file locked" / Disk Write Error

If Steam fails to download Wallpaper Engine either while installing or updating the app, it is most likely your antivirus deleting files, putting files into quarantine or blocking entire directories on your disk without informing you about this. You will get 'content file locked' or 'access denied' errors in Steam. This needs to be resolved in your antivirus by undoing the changes it did to your PC, most antivirus programs have a quarantine window from where you can restore files or create a whitelist. Make sure your antivirus application ignores the following directories:

* `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine`
* `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\downloads`
* `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\downloading`

*If your Steam or Wallpaper Engine is installed in a different directory, you need to adjust the directories to your actual Steam installation path.*
