# Wallpaper Engine 구형 버전으로 돌아가기

With the release of Wallpaper Engine 2.5, support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 has ended. Additionally, some older editor projects can also only be fully edited with older versions of Wallpaper Engine.

You can still access an outdated version of Wallpaper Engine via Steam to regain access to these features.

## Opting into the older compatibility branch

To revert back to Wallpaper Engine 2.4, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Wallpaper Engine in Steam and select **Properties**.
2. In the new window that appears, click on the **Betas** tab.
3. For the **Beta participation** option, select the version labelled `Windows 7 support`.
4. Close the settings window. Steam will now automatically download Wallpaper Engine 2.4.

## Reverting back to the latest version

To revert back to the latest version of the app, follow the steps in the previous section. However, instead of the `Windows 7 support` version, select **None** from the beta participation list.
