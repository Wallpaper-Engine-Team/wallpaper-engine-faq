# 32비트 및 64비트 버전

We recommend using the 64-bit version of Wallpaper Engine since the 64-bit version can handle larger files (more than 2GB). Other than that, the two versions are the same and also deliver the same level of visual fidelity and performance.

In rare cases, switching to the 32-bit version may help you resolve issues with broken 64-bit Windows components, drivers, video codec packs and other app incompatibilities. This may help you fix specific Wallpaper Engine problems without resolving the underlying issue on your system.

**Please Note:** *"Web"*-type wallpapers will always be executed with a 32-bit executable *(webwallpaper32.exe)*. The same applies to the user interface of Wallpaper Engine *(ui32.exe)*. The 64-bit option only applies when selecting wallpapers of the type *"Scene"* or *"Video"*.

## Windows 실행과 함께 32 또는 64비트 버전의 Wallpaper Engine 자동 시작 설정 방법

First, completely turn off Wallpaper Engine via the tray icon (right-click on the Wallpaper Engine icon in the Windows tray, then select "Quit"). Do not skip this step, as Steam will otherwise not restart Wallpaper Engine and only bring the already running version to the foreground.

Once Wallpaper Engine is turned off, go to Steam and start either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, depending on which version you want to automatically start. Next, go to the Wallpaper Engine settings and at the top of the "General" tab, enable the automatic startup functionality. 이미 활성화되었다면, 완전히 끈 다음 다시 켭니다. 그러면 현재 버전이 Windows와 함께 자동으로 시작되는 버전으로 등록됩니다.
