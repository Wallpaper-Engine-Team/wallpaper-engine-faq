# 창작마당 약관 부록

Wallpaper Engine 2.0 출시와 함께 창작마당 배경화면을 자신의 Android 모바일 기기로 이전할 수 있게 되었습니다. 모바일 기기는 창작마당 콘텐츠에 직접 접근할 수 없으며, 자신의 배경화면을 Windows Wallpaper Engine에서 Android 버전으로 이전해야 합니다.

If you have created wallpapers for Wallpaper Engine in the past, you need to accept the latest Wallpaper Engine Workshop addendum before users can transfer your wallpapers to their mobile devices. Wallpaper Engine will prevent users from transferring wallpapers to the mobile app without the consent of the wallpaper creator.

Since transferring Steam Workshop content to mobile devices has never been done before, the Steam Workshop Agreement does not cover this type of activity. We created an addendum to the Steam Workshop Agreement to ensure content creators are aware of the ability to transfer content to mobile devices. You can review and accept the addendum in either of the links below:

* [Workshop Addendum (View in Web Browser)](https://store.steampowered.com/workshopeula/431960/)
* <a href="steam://url/WorkshopEula/431960/">Workshop Addendum (View in Steam)</a>

If you are trying to use a wallpaper from a content creator that has not yet agreed to the latest Workshop addendum, please ask the content creator to review the latest addendum. You will be able to transfer the wallpaper to your Android mobile device once the creator has accepted the latest agreement.
