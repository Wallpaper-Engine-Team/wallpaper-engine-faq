# 검색에서 특정 배경화면이 제외됩니다

Always use the Workshop tab in the application to search for new wallpapers. The Steam Workshop website does not have the same filtering abilities as the app and will show you too much content you are not interested in.

## 특정 장르 제외 (예: 아니메)

You can filter out categories you do not like in the application. Open up the "Workshop" tab in Wallpaper Engine and enable the filter sidebar by clicking on the "Filter results" button in the upper left corner. Deselect all categories you do not like to see in your results.

You can also use the **Filter Settings** button and then click on **Hide Anime** to automatically disable the categories that contain the most anime-type content. You can still manually alter the categories on the left afterwards but the **Reset filters** buttons will keep anime categories unselected as long as the **Hide Anime** option is enabled in the filter settings.

## 특정 나이 등급 제외

Steam 창작마당은 노출과 같은 일정 수준의 성인 콘텐츠를 허용합니다. 이런 콘텐츠를 보고 싶지 않으면, 필터에서 "모두" 나이 등급만 활성화하세요.

Most content is tagged correctly and this will filter out the large majority of mature content. If you still come across adult content which has been rated for "Everyone", please use the report functionality in the app. The content will be re-classified or banned after a review.

## 규정 위반 콘텐츠 신고

We and the Steam administrators / moderators remove wallpapers breaking the rules on a daily basis. Please report Workshop submissions that break the guidelines to help us find them.

The Workshop allows users to publicize works without us being able to check them prior to them being visible, this is how the Steam Workshop works and not something we can change. We can only remove submissions after they have been uploaded. If this is a problem for you, make sure to enable the *Approved* tag in the filter settings as these are hand-picked and manually-checked wallpapers. Be sure to read the sections above on how to configure your filter settings so that you can simply remove certain types of content that you do not wish to see.
