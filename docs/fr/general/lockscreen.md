# Wallpaper Engine sur l'écran de verrouillage Windows

The Windows lock screen is a protected area of Windows which does not allow for live and dynamic wallpapers. Microsoft has purposefully built it this way as a security measure.

However, you can still configure Wallpaper Engine to override the static lock screen image with a snapshot of your current live wallpaper. To do this, enable the **Override lock screen image** option in the **General** tab of the Wallpaper Engine settings.

As an alternative to relying on the lock screen, we suggest setting up Wallpaper Engine as a screensaver in combination with the **On resume, display logon screen** option enabled in the Windows screensaver settings. See our screensaver guide on how to configure Wallpaper Engine as your screensaver:
