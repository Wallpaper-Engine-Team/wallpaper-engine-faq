# Playlist Causes focus loss / minimizes games

If you have a playlist with wallpapers of the type **Web** and experience focus loss while playing games, make sure to pause the playlist while other applications are fullscreen. You can do so by turning **off** the **Allow wallpaper to change while paused** option in the playlist settings) or alternatively remove the web-based wallpapers from the playlist.

Chromium itself - which is the software used to display "Web" type wallpapers - is stealing the focus of your current window when loading a new wallpaper so we cannot fix this issue easily unfortunately.
