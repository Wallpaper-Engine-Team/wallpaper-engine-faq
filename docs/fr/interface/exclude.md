# Exclure certains fonds d'écran de la recherche

Utilisez l'onglet Workshop pour chercher de nouveaux fonds d'écran. Le site web du Workshop Steam n'a pas les mêmes capacités de filtrage que l'application et vous montrera beaucoup trop de contenu.

## Exclure certains genres de fonds d'écran

Vous pouvez exclure les catégories que vous n'aimez pas dans l'application. Open up the "Workshop" tab in Wallpaper Engine and enable the filter sidebar by clicking on the "Filter results" button in the upper left corner. Deselect all categories you do not like to see in your results.

If you do not like seeing anime wallpapers, remove the *Anime* and *MMD (Miku-Miku-Dance)* categories. Additionally, you may also want to remove *Cartoon* and *Girls* as they also contain some anime but you are more likely to filter out other content as well.

## Excluding certain age ratings

The Steam Workshop permits a certain degree of adult content, such as nudity. If you do not want to see this kind of content, only enable the "Everyone" age rating in the filters:

Most content is tagged correctly and this will filter out the large majority of mature content. If you still come across adult content which has been rated for "Everyone", please use the report functionality in the app. The content will be re-classified or banned after a review.

## Reporting rule-breaking content

We and the Steam administrators / moderators remove wallpapers breaking the rules on a daily basis. Please report Workshop submissions that break the guidelines to help us find them.

The Workshop allows users to publicize works without us being able to check them prior to them being visible, this is how the Steam Workshop works and not something we can change. We can only remove submissions after they have been uploaded. If this is a problem for you, make sure to enable the *Approved* tag in the filter settings as these are hand-picked and manually-checked wallpapers. Be sure to read the sections above on how to configure your filter settings so that you can simply remove certain types of content that you do not wish to see.
