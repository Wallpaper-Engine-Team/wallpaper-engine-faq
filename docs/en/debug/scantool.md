# Use the Wallpaper Engine scan tool to create a debug log

If you are having technical issues with Wallpaper Engine that you are unable to solve with the help of the FAQ, you can create a system log file which you can share with us when contacting us:

1. Make sure Wallpaper Engine is running (if possible).
2. Choose the 4th launch option in Steam (*"Check for System Conflicts"*, see below for a short video).
3. Click on **Save Full Log** and save it to your desktop (see below for a short video).
4. Share the log file with our developers:
    * Send the log file to **logs@wallpaperengine.io**.
        * **IMPORTANT:** If you use this email address, please share a link to your discussion and tell us your username.
5. *Optional:* If you are experiencing crashes, please check your *wallpaper_engine* directory for any **.mdmp** files and also send them to us either via email (**logs@wallpaperengine.io**) or by uploading them somewhere. If you can find a lot of .mdmp files, please just send the newest ones.

::: tip
Even if the scan tool does not report any issues at first glance, a deeper investigation of the log file often reveals common computer issues which help us to quickly provide advice to you how to fix your technical issues.
