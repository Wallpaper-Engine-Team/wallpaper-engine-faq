# Exclude certain wallpapers from the search

Always use the Workshop tab in the application to search for new wallpapers. The Steam Workshop website does not have the same filtering abilities as the app and will show you too much content you are not interested in.

## Excluding mature content

The Steam Workshop permits a certain degree of adult content, such as nudity. There are two layers of filtering age-restricted content, both of which you need to configure:

1. Steam account mature content preferences
2. Wallpaper Engine search filters

### 1. Steam Account Preferences

First, make sure to properly configure your Steam Community content filters. Open Steam, then click on your user name in the upper right corner and select **Store Preferences**. Alternatively, click on the following link and access your Steam account preferences from your web browser (make sure you are logged into the correct Steam account):

* [Click here to view your Steam content preferences](https://store.steampowered.com/account/preferences/)

You will be presented with a list of mature content options. Make sure to select your preferences for the **Community** column which is used for Workshop content. Watch the video below to see the setup process.

::: warning Regional Restrictions
**Keep in mind that some adult content preferences are not available in various countries and regions due to local laws enforced by Steam.**

Steam detects your location based on your IP address or purchase history. If you live in a region where you should be able to access these content options but are not presented with them, please contact Steam Support for further assistance.

Make sure to restart the Wallpaper Engine user interface when making changes to your Steam content preferences, otherwise your changes may not have an immediate effect

### 2. Wallpaper Engine Age Rating Filter

Once you have set up your Steam content preferences in Steam, you can use the Wallpaper Engine age filters to filter content on-the-fly. Click on the **Filter results** button in the upper left corner in the app, then navigate to the **age rating** section and enable or disable the filters according to your preferences:

  <source src="/videos/filterage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Most content is tagged correctly and this will filter out the large majority of mature content. If you still come across adult content which has been rated for "Everyone", please use the report functionality in the app. The content will be re-classified or banned after a review.

## Excluding certain genres (anime, for example)

You can filter out categories you do not like in the application. Open up the "Workshop" tab in Wallpaper Engine and enable the filter sidebar by clicking on the "Filter results" button in the upper left corner. Deselect all categories you do not like to see in your results.

You can also use the **Filter Settings** button and then click on **Hide Anime** to automatically disable the categories that contain the most anime-type content. You can still manually alter the categories on the left afterwards but the **Reset filters** buttons will keep anime categories unselected as long as the **Hide Anime** option is enabled in the filter settings.

## Reporting rule-breaking content

We and the Steam administrators / moderators remove wallpapers breaking the rules on a daily basis. Please report Workshop submissions that break the guidelines to help us find them.

The Workshop allows users to publicize works without us being able to check them prior to them being visible, this is how the Steam Workshop works and not something we can change. We can only remove submissions after they have been uploaded. If this is a problem for you, make sure to enable the *Approved* tag in the filter settings as these are hand-picked and manually-checked wallpapers. Be sure to read the sections above on how to configure your filter settings so that you can simply remove certain types of content that you do not wish to see.
