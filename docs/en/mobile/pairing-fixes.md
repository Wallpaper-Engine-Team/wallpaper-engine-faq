## Mobile Pairing Problem Solving

If you cannot pair your mobile device to your computer, a firewall or local network setting is very likely at fault. Check the following possible problem sources:

* Ensure that your phone and computer are connected to the same local network.
* Ensure no firewall is blocking Wallpaper Engine from communicating with your local network.
* Ensure your network router is not blocking your devices from communicating with each other.
    * Make sure your router is not blocking network traffic between devices.
    * Turn on **UPnP** (**"Universal Plug and Play"**) in your router settings.
* Disable any sort of VPN or proxy software on your computer and your mobile device which can interfere with the communication between your devices.
* Double-check that Wallpaper Engine on Windows and your mobile device are both up-to-date and running.

### Backup solution: Manually importing a Wallpaper File (.mpkg)

Should you be able unable to fix the connection between your computer and your mobile device, you can still manually transfer your wallpapers onto your mobile device. First, select the wallpapers you want to export in Wallpaper Engine, then right-click on them and select **Send to Mobile Device**, followed by clicking on **Export .mpkg**.

Once Wallpaper Engine has created the .mpkg files for your wallpapers, you can either transfer them to your mobile device by moving the files onto your mobile device via USB or by copying the files onto an SD card. Alternatively you can also use any file sharing service on your mobile device or send them to yourself via a messaging service or even via email (if the file size is not a problem).

Once the files are on your mobile device, open up Wallpaper Engine on your mobile device and use the **Import File** functionality to directly import the .mpkg files into the app by selecting them from the directory that you have placed them in.
