# 从搜索中排除某些壁纸

Always use the Workshop tab in the application to search for new wallpapers. The Steam Workshop website does not have the same filtering abilities as the app and will show you too much content you are not interested in.

## 排除某些样式（例如动漫）

You can filter out categories you do not like in the application. Open up the "Workshop" tab in Wallpaper Engine and enable the filter sidebar by clicking on the "Filter results" button in the upper left corner. Deselect all categories you do not like to see in your results.

You can also use the **Filter Settings** button and then click on **Hide Anime** to automatically disable the categories that contain the most anime-type content. You can still manually alter the categories on the left afterwards but the **Reset filters** buttons will keep anime categories unselected as long as the **Hide Anime** option is enabled in the filter settings.

  <source src="/videos/filtercontent.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## 排除某些年龄分级

Steam 创意工坊允许一定程度的成人内容，例如裸体。 如果不想看到此类内容，您只需在筛选器中启用“所有人”年龄分级：

<video width="100%" autoplay loop>
  <source src="/videos/filterage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Most content is tagged correctly and this will filter out the large majority of mature content. If you still come across adult content which has been rated for "Everyone", please use the report functionality in the app. The content will be re-classified or banned after a review.

## 举报违规内容

We and the Steam administrators / moderators remove wallpapers breaking the rules on a daily basis. Please report Workshop submissions that break the guidelines to help us find them.

The Workshop allows users to publicize works without us being able to check them prior to them being visible, this is how the Steam Workshop works and not something we can change. We can only remove submissions after they have been uploaded. If this is a problem for you, make sure to enable the *Approved* tag in the filter settings as these are hand-picked and manually-checked wallpapers. Be sure to read the sections above on how to configure your filter settings so that you can simply remove certain types of content that you do not wish to see.
