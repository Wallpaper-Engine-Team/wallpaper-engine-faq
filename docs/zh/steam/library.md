# Steam 库中找不到 Wallpaper Engine

如果您已在 Steam 上购买 Wallpaper Engine，但在 Steam 库中找不到该应用，最常见的原因是您的 Steam 配置为仅显示**游戏**。 Wallpaper Engine is not a game, so be sure to enable the **Software** filter by clicking on the Steam library filter options at the top of your library tab as shown here:

If this filter does not exist for you or if you are still unable to find Wallpaper Engine in your library, be sure to check the purchase history of the Steam account to double-check that the account you are using really owns Wallpaper Engine. You can view your purchase history on the following page (make sure you are logged into the correct Steam account):

* [Steam Account Purchase History](https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/)

If you are still unable to find Wallpaper Engine in your Steam account, please reach out to the Steam Support team directly. Unfortunately developers on Steam have no access to Steam account data and cannot provide support with this, only the Steam team can help with account and purchase related issues:
