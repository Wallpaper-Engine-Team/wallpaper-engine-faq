# Windows N：mfplat.dll 丢失

Windows N 不具备媒体功能！ You need to install the correct Media Feature Pack for your specific Windows version and build number:

* Windows 10:
  * [Media Feature Pack Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack) (page only provided in English by Microsoft)

* Windows 7:
  * [Media Feature Pack Download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=16546)

**Make sure to install the x64 and x86 version.**

If it still shows the same error then **you have installed the wrong version**, try installing the correct version and restarting the PC. Should nothing work and it is still missing, your system files are probably defective, try restoring the system to an earlier state or reinstall Windows.

:::warning Please note Every time Microsoft releases a major update to Windows 10, you must install the media feature pack again. If this undesirable for you, consider switching to a normal version of Windows as the other versions are always shipped with these features!

**The whole point of Windows N is that it does not have media features. So if this is not what you want, you should not use Windows N.** :::
