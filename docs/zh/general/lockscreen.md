# Windows 锁定屏幕上的 Wallpaper Engine

We frequently get asked if it is possible to set a Wallpaper Engine wallpaper on the Windows lock screen. Unfortunately this is not possible due to limitations in Windows itself. The lock screen is a protected area of Windows which cannot be modified without hacking Windows. This serves system security as applications should not be able to add malicious content to the login window. For this reason, Wallpaper Engine cannot add wallpapers to the lock screen and we cannot add this feature in the future either.
