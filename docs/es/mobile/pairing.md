# Emparejar un dispositivo móvil con Windows

Puedes emparejar dispositivos móviles con el ordenador de forma inalámbrica para transferir tu colección de fondos a la aplicación de Wallpaper Engine. La aplicación de Android no puede descargarse fondos directamente desde Steam Workshop porque eso tiene que hacerlo Steam directamente.

### Preparar Wallpaper Engine en Windows

In the **Windows** app, click on the **Mobile** button in the upper right corner of the user interface. The mobile device overview will open up. At the bottom device overview, click on the **Connect new Device** button. Wallpaper Engine will show you a 4-digit PIN that you can use to pair one mobile device.

### Connecting Your Mobile Device

In the Wallpaper Engine mobile companion app, click on **Add** in the lower right corner, followed by clicking on **Pair with Computer**. The Wallpaper Engine app will search your local network for running instances of Wallpaper Engine for Windows. Your Windows computer should appear after a few seconds, allowing you to connect to it by clicking on it. If you are connecting for the first time, you will be asked to enter the 4-digit PIN (see Windows section above). The PIN is an additional security measure to ensure unauthorized users cannot connect to your computer without your knowledge.

Once you have entered your PIN, the status bar in the mobile app turns green and shows which computer its connected to. On the Windows app, the **Mobile** button is also colored green now to indicate that a mobile connection is active.

## Mobile Pairing Problem Solving

If you cannot pair your mobile device to your computer, a firewall or local network setting is very likely at fault. Check the following possible problem sources:

* Ensure that your phone and computer are connected to the same local network.
* Ensure no firewall is blocking Wallpaper Engine from communicating with your local network.
* Ensure your network router is not blocking your devices from communicating with each other.
* Double-check that Wallpaper Engine on Windows and your mobile device are both up-to-date and running.
