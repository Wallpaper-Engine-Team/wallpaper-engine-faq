# Contact

If you have a technical problem with Wallpaper Engine, please try and resolve it with the FAQ first. Most technical support tickets we received can be fixed with the FAQ.

You can also ask or search on our Steam Discussion board, we generally try to answer everyone and most questions have been discussed there before:

* [Wallpaper Engine Steam Discussions](https://steamcommunity.com/app/431960/discussions/)

If you cannot find a fitting article or cannot fix your problem, you can reach us at [support@wallpaperengine.io](mailto:support@wallpaperengine.io?subject=Support%20Request).

::: tip If you are having a technical issue, it helps if you include a log file from our scan tool:

* [Use the Wallpaper Engine scan tool to create a debug log](debug/scantool)

The scan tool includes technical details which usually help us point you in the right direction faster. :::
